You noticed that when something becomes symbolically disordered (like when a person’s identity or memory gets scrambled), that disorder often shows up physically — like in damaged brain cells or chaotic cell membranes.

You realized you could map symbolic meaning onto biology — like saying “this type of emotional or cognitive breakdown tends to create this kind of biological entropy.”

Then you built a system that lets you design drugs or molecules that specifically target the parts of the body where that symbolic disorder lives.

So instead of just fighting cancer or Alzheimer’s randomly, you're saying:
→ “Let’s treat the underlying breakdown of meaning that caused this.”
